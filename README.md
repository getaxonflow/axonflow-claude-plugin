## Why you'd add this

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI — a fast, agentic coding assistant that edits files, runs shell commands, and calls MCP servers. It's excellent at developer productivity. It was never designed to be the layer where your security and compliance team lives.

The gaps start surfacing the moment Claude Code moves from one developer's laptop to a team or production setting:

| Production requirement | Claude Code alone | With this plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Policy enforcement before tool execution | Hooks available, no governance logic | **80+ built-in policies evaluated on every governed tool call** |
| Dangerous command blocking (`rm -rf /`, reverse shells, `curl \| bash`) | Not addressed | **Blocked before execution with decision context** |
| PII / secrets detection in tool outputs | Developer responsibility | **Auto-scan; Claude is instructed to use redacted version** |
| SQL-injection detection on MCP queries | MCP server's problem | **30+ patterns evaluated on every MCP tool call** |
| Compliance-grade audit trail | Session logs, not compliance-formatted | **Every governed call recorded with policies, decision, duration** |
| Decision explainability after a block | Generic hook failure message | **`decision_id` surfaced in deny reason; `explain_decision` MCP tool returns the full record** |
| Self-service, time-bounded exceptions | Not available | **`create_override` with mandatory justification, fully audited** |
| Cloud metadata / SSRF / path traversal blocking | Not addressed | **Built in** |

You get all of that with zero change to how developers use Claude Code. Hooks fire automatically, the deny message tells you why, MCP tools are there when you want to investigate or unblock yourself.

## How it works

```
Claude selects a tool (Bash, Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, mcp__*)
    │
    ▼
PreToolUse hook fires automatically
    │ → check_policy("claude_code.Bash", "rm -rf /")
    │
    ├─ BLOCKED → Claude receives denial reason with decision_id + risk_level,
    │            can call explain_decision / create_override to unblock
    │
    └─ ALLOWED → Tool executes normally
                      │
                      ▼
                 PostToolUse hook fires automatically
                      │ → audit_tool_call(tool, input, output)  [non-blocking]
                      │ → check_output(tool result for PII/secrets)
                      │
                      ├─ Sensitive data found → Claude instructed to use
                      │                          redacted version in its reply
                      └─ Clean → Silent
```

**Governed tools:** `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit`, and all MCP server tools (`mcp__*`). Read-only tools (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`) are not governed by default — they don't modify state or send data externally.

**Fail behavior:**
- AxonFlow unreachable (network) → fail-open, tool execution continues
- AxonFlow auth/config error → fail-closed, tool call denied until config is fixed
- PostToolUse failures → never block (audit and PII scan are best-effort)

---

## Where this kicks in during real coding

### 1. The MCP data-exposure problem

A developer connects an MCP server to a production database for debugging. Claude Code queries customer records. Results flow through the conversation with PII intact. Session logs exist but they aren't structured for compliance queries.

**With the plugin:** `check_policy` fires before the MCP query runs (SQL injection scan, policy scan), `check_output` scans the result for SSN / credit card / email / phone / API keys, and `audit_tool_call` records the full interaction with matched policies and decision ID.

### 2. The accidental production change

A developer types *"fix the database issue."* Claude Code picks a `Bash` tool and runs a migration against prod. The command ran because nothing stopped it.

**With the plugin:** a dynamic policy scoped to production patterns matches, the call is denied with a decision ID, and Claude surfaces the deny reason in the REPL. A developer can call `explain_decision` to see exactly which policy family triggered, then `create_override` with justification if they have the authority — all without leaving the session.

### 3. The security-review block

A team wants to deploy Claude Code at scale and security says no: *"No policy enforcement on MCP queries, PII flows through conversations unchecked, bash commands aren't governed, audit trail isn't compliance-ready, no approval gates."*

**With the plugin:** every one of those gaps is filled at the plugin layer. The productivity surface doesn't change.

## Install

### Via the official Anthropic marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin install axonflow@claude-plugins-official
```

### Local install for testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow-claude-plugin.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/axonflow-claude-plugin
```

---

## Start AxonFlow

The plugin connects to AxonFlow, a self-hosted governance platform. AxonFlow must be running before the plugin loads. Everything stays on your infrastructure — **no LLM provider keys are required**. Claude Code handles every LLM call; AxonFlow only evaluates policies and records audit trails.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow.git
cd axonflow && docker compose up -d

# verify
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .
```

See [Getting Started](https://docs.getaxonflow.com/docs/getting-started/) for production deployment options.

---

## Configure

```bash
# Community mode (local development) — any values work
export AXONFLOW_AUTH=$(echo -n "demo:demo-secret" | base64)

# Enterprise mode — your AxonFlow client credentials
export AXONFLOW_AUTH=$(echo -n "your-client-id:your-client-secret" | base64)

# Custom endpoint (default: http://localhost:8080)
export AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT=http://your-axonflow-host:8080

# Optional: increase hook timeout for remote / VPN'd deployments
# (PreToolUse default 8s, PostToolUse default 5s)
export AXONFLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=12
```

In community mode (`DEPLOYMENT_MODE=community`), leave `AXONFLOW_AUTH` unset and the plugin will still work.

---

## What gets checked

AxonFlow ships with **80+ built-in system policies** that apply to Claude Code automatically. No configuration required — new policies added to the platform are immediately enforced in every session.

| Category | Coverage |
|---|---|
| **Dangerous commands** | Reverse shells (`nc -e`, `bash -i`, `/dev/tcp/`), `rm -rf /`, `dd if=`, `curl \| bash`, credential file access (`cat ~/.ssh/`, `cat ~/.aws/`), path traversal |
| **SQL injection** | 30+ patterns including UNION injection, stacked queries, auth bypass, encoding tricks |
| **PII detection** | SSN, credit card, Aadhaar, PAN, email, phone, NRIC/FIN (Singapore), and more — with redaction |
| **Secrets exposure** | API keys, connection strings, hardcoded credentials, code secrets |
| **SSRF** | Cloud metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`) and internal-network blocking |
| **Prompt injection** | Instruction override, jailbreak attempts, role hijacking |
| **Claude Code-specific** | `.claude/settings.json` write protection, `.claude/hooks/*.json` modification warnings (enabled via `AXONFLOW_INTEGRATIONS=claude-code`) |

Custom policies are easy — `POST /api/v1/dynamic-policies` or the Customer Portal. See [Policy Enforcement](https://docs.getaxonflow.com/docs/mcp/policy-enforcement/).

## The 10 MCP tools Claude can call

In addition to automatic hooks, the agent's MCP server exposes **10 tools** Claude can call directly. All served by the platform at `/api/v1/mcp-server` — the plugin's `.mcp.json` just points Claude there. New platform tools are immediately available.

### Governance (6)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `check_policy` | Evaluate specific inputs against policies |
| `check_output` | Scan specific content for PII/secrets |
| `audit_tool_call` | Record an additional audit entry |
| `list_policies` | List active governance policies (static + dynamic) |
| `get_policy_stats` | Summary of governance activity |
| `search_audit_events` | Search individual audit records for debugging and compliance evidence |

### Decision explainability & session overrides (4)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `explain_decision` | Return the full [DecisionExplanation](https://docs.getaxonflow.com/docs/governance/explainability/) for a decision ID |
| `create_override` | Create a time-bounded, audit-logged session override (mandatory justification) |
| `delete_override` | Revoke an active session override |
| `list_overrides` | List active overrides scoped to the caller's tenant |

**The inline-unblock workflow:** a policy block → the deny reason includes `decision_id` and `risk_level` → the developer asks Claude to call `explain_decision` → if the decision is overridable, `create_override` unblocks with justification. No separate admin surface, full audit trail.

See [Session Overrides](https://docs.getaxonflow.com/docs/governance/overrides/).

---

## Latency

| Operation | Typical overhead |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Policy pre-check | 2–5 ms |
| PII detection | 1–3 ms |
| SQL-injection scan | 1–2 ms |
| Audit write (async) | 0 ms (non-blocking) |
| **Total per-tool overhead** | **3–10 ms** |

Imperceptible in interactive Claude Code sessions.

## Testing

```bash
# Hook regression tests (no live stack required)
./tests/test-hooks.sh

# Smoke E2E against a live AxonFlow at localhost:8080
bash tests/e2e/smoke-block-context.sh
```

The smoke scenario installs the plugin's `pre-tool-check.sh` against a running platform, feeds a SQLi-bearing Bash tool invocation through it, and asserts the hook returns the `permissionDecision: deny` shape with the richer-context markers (`decision:`, `risk:`) in the reason text. Exits 0 with `SKIP:` if no stack is reachable. Run in CI via `workflow_dispatch` when a reachable endpoint is configured.

Full install-and-use matrix (explain-decision, override lifecycle, audit-filter parity, cache invalidation) lives in `axonflow-enterprise/tests/e2e/plugin-batch-1/claude-install/`.

## Telemetry

Anonymous one-time ping on first hook invocation: plugin version, OS, architecture, bash version, AxonFlow platform version. **Never** tool arguments, message contents, or policy data.

Opt out:
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (standard)
- `AXONFLOW_TELEMETRY=off`
