# Changelog

## [0.3.1] - Release Pending (2026-04-09)

### Added

- **Decision-matrix regression tests** for the v0.3.0 hook fail-open/fail-closed behavior. The v0.3.0 release only added a single stderr-string assertion update; the new branches (JSON-RPC -32601 method-not-found, -32602 invalid-params, -32603 internal, -32700 parse, and unknown error codes) were completely untested. This release adds mock-server cases for every branch so the decision matrix is now covered end-to-end. Claude Code's hook protocol uses JSON output with `permissionDecision: deny` instead of an exit-code `block`, so the test assertions check the JSON body for `"deny"` + `"governance blocked"` on fail-closed branches.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Hook fail-open/fail-closed hardening.** `scripts/pre-tool-check.sh` now distinguishes curl exit code (network failure) from HTTP success with an error body. Fail-closed (`permissionDecision: deny`) only on operator-fixable JSON-RPC errors: auth failures (-32001), method-not-found (-32601), and invalid-params (-32602). Fail-open (exit 0, allow) on everything else: curl timeouts/DNS failures/connection refused, empty response, server-internal errors (-32603), parse errors (-32700), and unknown error codes. Prevents transient governance infrastructure issues from blocking legitimate dev workflows while still catching broken configurations.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `AXONFLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable to tune Claude Code hook HTTP timeouts for remote or high-latency AxonFlow deployments.
- Plugin logo for marketplace and directory listings.
- `SECURITY.md` with plugin-specific vulnerability reporting guidance.

### Changed

- README now clarifies that the Claude Code plugin itself does not send direct telemetry pings; telemetry settings apply to the underlying AxonFlow deployment and SDKs.

### Security

- Pinned all GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Added Dependabot configuration for weekly GitHub Actions updates.
- Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` to test workflow (least privilege).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- MCP server integration with 6 governance tools: `check_policy`, `check_output`, `audit_tool_call`, `list_policies`, `get_policy_stats`, `search_audit_events`
- Automatic PreToolUse hook: evaluates tool inputs against AxonFlow policies before execution. Blocks dangerous commands, reverse shells, SSRF, credential access, path traversal.
- Automatic PostToolUse hook: records tool execution in AxonFlow audit trail and scans output for PII/secrets. Scans Bash redirect commands (`echo ... > file`) when stdout is empty.
- Audit logging for blocked attempts: denied tool calls are recorded in the audit trail for compliance evidence.
- Fail-open on network failure, fail-closed on auth/config errors.
- Governed tools: `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit`, and all MCP tools (`mcp__*`).
- `scripts/mcp-auth-headers.sh` — auth header generator for MCP server connection. Supports community mode (no auth) and enterprise mode (Basic auth via `AXONFLOW_AUTH`).
- `tests/E2E_TESTING_PLAYBOOK.md` — comprehensive testing playbook with 12 test cases covering hooks, MCP tools, integration activation, and edge cases.
- 21 regression tests with mock MCP server (`tests/test-hooks.sh`), 18 live-mode tests against AxonFlow.
- CI workflow: shell syntax check, regression tests, plugin structure validation.

### Configuration

- `AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT` — AxonFlow Agent URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- `AXONFLOW_AUTH` — Base64-encoded `clientId:clientSecret` for Basic auth
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — must be set when using `--plugin-dir` (Claude Code does not set this automatically)
- No LLM provider keys required — Claude Code handles LLM calls, AxonFlow only enforces policies.

### Architecture

Uses `headersHelper` for MCP server authentication (Claude Code's HTTP MCP client requires this instead of static headers). Matches the OpenClaw plugin pattern:

| OpenClaw Hook | Claude Code Hook | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `before_tool_call` | PreToolUse | Policy check before execution |
| `after_tool_call` | PostToolUse | Audit trail recording |
| `message_sending` | PostToolUse | PII/secret scanning on output |
